| Next Gen Sequenceing Reccursive DNA Fragment Re-assembly | Here the we were asked to rebuild kilobase lengthed DNA sequences given a very large set of fragmented DNA that included duplicate fragments; the typical output of a Genomic NGS procedure. We were graded on accuracy of our rebuilt fragments as well as our liberal use of reccursion in our algorithms. | 10/10
