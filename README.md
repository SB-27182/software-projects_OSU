<h1> Software Projects </h1>
<h5> These were completed in OSU's famous (infamous?) software-1 and software-2 sequence.<br> <br>See below for a synopsis of several projects and the accompanying grade recieved.

| Project | Description | Grade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Binary Search Tree Algorithm](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-2/S2P4-BinarySearchTree_Implementation_via_SetKernel) | We were tasked with building and testing the kernel class that implemented a binary tree interface; we were required to write both a depth-first search algorithm, and a breadth-first-search algorithm. | **10/10**
| [Next Gen Sequenceing: Reccursive String Fragment Re-assembly](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-1/S1P9-NGS_DNA_ReccursiveFragmentReassembly) | Here we were tasked with rebuilding sequences of data given a very large set of fragmented data; analagous to a typical output of a Genomic NGS procedure. We were graded on accuracy of our rebuilt fragments as well as our propensity to use reccursion in our algorithms. | **10/10**
| [Map-Key Data Type via a Hashing Kernel](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-2/S2P3-MapDataType_Implementation_via_HashingKernel)| Here we had to write the kernel implementation of a discrete, bijective, map-key data type; our kernel was required to store map-key pairs via a hashing algorithm of our design.| 10/10
