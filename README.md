| [Next Gen Sequenceing: Reccursive DNA Fragment Re-assembly](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-1/S1P9-NGS_DNA_ReccursiveFragmentReassembly) | Here the we were asked to rebuild kilobase lengthed DNA sequences given a very large set of fragmented DNA that included duplicate fragments; the typical output of a Genomic NGS procedure. We were graded on accuracy of our rebuilt fragments as well as our propensity to use reccursion in our algorithms. | **10/10**
