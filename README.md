| Project | Description | Grade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Binary Search Tree Algorithm](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-2/S2P4-BinarySearchTree_Implementation_via_SetKernel) | We were tasked with building and testing the kernel class that implemented a binary tree interface; we were required to write both a depth-first-search algorithm, and a breadth-first-search algorithm. | **10/10**
| [Parser and Context-Free-Grammar Implementation](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-2/S2P8-Parser) | We were required to write and test a recursive sequence parser. In other words, using the rules of a Context-Free-Grammar, we would tokenize, and parse "language" (sequence specific data) into a computational data-type that a computer could understand for downstream tasks. | **10/10**
| [Next Gen Sequenceing: Reccursive String Fragment Re-assembly](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-1/S1P9-NGS_DNA_ReccursiveFragmentReassembly) | Here we were tasked with rebuilding sequences of data given a very large set of fragmented data; analagous to a typical output of a Genomic NGS procedure. We were graded on accuracy of our rebuilt fragments as well as our propensity to use reccursion in our algorithms. | **10/10**
| [Map-Key Data Type via a Hashing Kernel](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-2/S2P3-MapDataType_Implementation_via_HashingKernel)| Here we had to write and test the kernel of a discrete, bijective, map-key data type; further, our kernel was required to store map-key pairs via a hashing algorithm of our design.| **10/10**
| [Double-Linked Node Implementation](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-2/S2P6-DoubleLinkedNodes_KernelClass) | We were tasked with building a design scheme incorporating a kernel-class, which itself used both a static-class (pointer) and a instantiated class for nodes. These instantiated nodes each had fields containing which other nodes they connected to, ie: edge-fields. | **10/10**
| [XML-Tree Recursive Traversal](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-1/S1P7-XMLTree_ReccursiveTraversal) | In this project, we had to write and test an algorithm that was able to fully explore an XML tree, and summarize it's structure and data in an html file. | **10/10**
| [Heap Sort Implementation](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-2/S2P5-HeapSort_KernelClass) | This project placed an emphasis on sorting data while simultaneously having a minimal impact on computer memory. | 9/10
| [Cryptography](https://github.com/SB-27182/software-projects_OSU/tree/master/Software-1/S1P8-CryptoAlgorithm) | Introduction to cryptography; emphasis on discrete data types (ie: the NaturalNumbers java class). | 10/10
